title: "Cybersecurity skills shortage you say?"

It seems like everywhere you turn, someone is publishing an article about the cybersecurity skills shortage. Over the summer of 2021, cybersecurity professional surveyed by ISSA (Information Systems Security Association International) reported that 95% of respondents said that the cybersecurity skills shortage has not gotten better over than past few years and 44% say it has only gotten worse (https://www.issa.org/cybersecurity-skills-crisis-continues-for-fifth-year-perpetuated-by-lack-of-business-investment/). 

It seems like it would be a great time to get into the industry, but people interested in cybersecurity/information security have been bombarded by mixed messages about what skills, training, and experience they need to get hired in the field. I hope to help in my own way by writing about what I have found helpful in case it may help someone else out there. 

In my next entry, I'll let you know how I got my own start in the industry. I didn't spend 10 years as a system administrator or get a computer science degree, but I was able to use transferable skills to help get a foot in the door. More coming soon!
